# The Problem With How BCH Teams Manage Treasury Today

## Introduction

Most teams in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem manage treasury the same way:

- A shared wallet
- A few trusted signers
- Verbal rules about how money should be spent

It works — until it doesn't.

As treasury size grows, the risks grow with it.

FlowGuard starts with a simple premise:

**Treasury rules should be enforced by the blockchain, not by memory or trust.**

## The Real Risks Teams Face

Let's break this down clearly.

### 1. Shared Wallet Risk

Even with multisig, there are real issues:

- A signer disappears or loses access
- A signer is compromised
- Signers disagree about what "allowed spending" means

Multisig only enforces **how many signatures are needed**.

It does not enforce:

- Spending limits
- Budget cycles
- Time-based restrictions
- Allowed recipients
- Structured releases

The logic is still off-chain.

### 2. Informal Budget Rules

Most projects operate like this:

> "We'll only spend X per month."  
> "We won't exceed Y without discussion."  
> "We'll release funds milestone by milestone."

But those rules exist in:

- Telegram chats
- Notion docs
- Google Sheets
- Verbal agreements

**The blockchain doesn't know those rules.**

So the blockchain cannot enforce them.

### 3. Governance Drift

As teams grow:

- More contributors
- Larger treasury
- Grant allocations
- Payroll commitments

Treasury management becomes coordination infrastructure.

If that infrastructure is weak, everything built on top of it is fragile.

## What Changes When Rules Move On-Chain

FlowGuard approaches treasury differently.

Instead of trusting that signers will follow off-chain rules, the rules are encoded directly in covenant contracts on Bitcoin Cash.

A FlowGuard vault enforces:

- M-of-N approval thresholds
- Per-cycle spending caps
- Time-based unlock windows
- Optional recipient allowlists

**Even if all signers agree, a payout cannot exceed the contract's constraints.**

The rules are part of the script.

Not part of a conversation.

## Why This Matters for BCH

Bitcoin Cash is already good at payments.

But for an ecosystem to grow, it needs:

- Structured grant distribution
- Contributor vesting
- Milestone-based funding
- DAO-style treasury control
- Transparent on-chain governance

If treasury logic lives off-chain, BCH is only a payment rail.

If treasury logic lives on-chain, BCH becomes programmable coordination infrastructure.

**That is a major difference.**

## Why Multisig Alone Is Not Enough

Multisig answers one question:

**"How many people must approve this transaction?"**

It does not answer:

- How much can be spent this month?
- When does the next allocation unlock?
- Has a milestone been reached?
- Is this payout within budget?

FlowGuard vaults extend multisig with policy enforcement.

Approval is necessary — but not sufficient.

The contract still checks:

- Spending cap
- Current cycle
- Unlock amount
- Contract state

This reduces human error and removes ambiguity.

## The Core Principle

If your project treasury is:

- Funding development
- Paying contributors
- Running grants
- Managing ecosystem capital

Then treasury logic should not rely on memory, goodwill, or discipline.

**It should be enforced by the chain.**

That is the starting point for FlowGuard.

## What Comes Next

In the next posts, we'll break down:

- How vault contracts enforce spending caps
- How streams use NFT commitments to track vesting
- How airdrops prevent double-claiming on-chain
- How governance votes are recorded in covenant state

All running on Bitcoin Cash.

This is not theory.

**This is implementation.**

## Closing

If you're building on BCH and managing real funds, ask yourself:

**Where do your treasury rules live?**

If the answer is "in chat," it might be time to move them on-chain.
