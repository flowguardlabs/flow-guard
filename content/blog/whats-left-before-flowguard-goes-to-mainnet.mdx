# What's Left Before FlowGuard Goes to Mainnet

## Introduction

FlowGuard has been tested end-to-end on Chipnet.

Vaults deploy.
Streams track state.
Proposals execute.
Budget unlocks enforce schedule.

But Chipnet is not mainnet.

This post outlines what remains before production deployment on Bitcoin Cash.

Clear checklist. No assumptions.

## 1. Covenant Signing UX Finalization

The core transaction flow is working:

Backend builds template → Wallet signs → Network validates

Before mainnet, UX needs refinement:

- Clear signer prompts
- Better transaction previews
- Error surface clarity
- Improved multi-signer coordination

The goal:

Reduce user error without weakening contract enforcement.

## 2. Independent Security Audit

Treasury infrastructure must be audited.

Audit scope includes:

- VaultCovenant enforcement logic
- Vesting commitment state transitions
- Merkle airdrop validation
- Governance threshold validation
- Edge-case transaction ordering

Focus areas:

- Signature validation
- Cap enforcement
- State mutation correctness
- Over-release prevention

Mainnet treasury logic must be reviewed before live capital is locked.

## 3. Mainnet Contract Deployment

Initial mainnet rollout will include:

Phase 1:

- Vaults
- Vesting Streams

Phase 2:

- Budget plans
- Governance modules
- Airdrops

Deployment will follow:

- Fresh contract compilation
- Verified bytecode
- Public contract address publication

No hidden upgrades.

## 4. Public Demo Treasury

A public treasury will be deployed on mainnet to demonstrate:

- Real vault
- Real signers
- Real cap enforcement
- Real proposal execution

This allows:

- Open inspection
- Community verification
- Live transparency

Infrastructure must be observable, not theoretical.

## 5. First DAO and Grant Onboarding

After deployment:

Target early adopters:

- BCH grant programs
- Developer collectives
- Hackathon prize pools
- Contributor payroll teams

FlowGuard will support onboarding:

- Treasury structuring
- Cap configuration
- Vesting design
- Governance integration

The goal is real usage, not just deployment.

## 6. Automation Layer (Executor Network)

Future phase:

- Automated cycle unlock triggers
- Scheduled execution bots
- Optional notification systems

Important:

Automation does not override contracts.
It only submits valid transactions.

Enforcement always remains on-chain.

## Why This Matters

Infrastructure credibility depends on:

- Audit discipline
- Production clarity
- Transparent deployment
- Real adoption

FlowGuard is not being positioned as "finished."

It is being positioned as:

Tested → Audited → Deployed → Adopted.

That sequence matters.

## Long-Term Direction

Beyond mainnet:

- Executor marketplace
- Treasury analytics layer
- Template DAO stacks
- BCH-native coordination tooling

Treasury management is foundational.

If done correctly, it supports:

- Grants
- Governance
- Contributor alignment
- Ecosystem capital allocation

## Closing

FlowGuard is not a demo submission.

It is being built as enforceable treasury infrastructure on Bitcoin Cash.

Chipnet proved mechanics.

Next:

Audit.
Deploy.
Onboard.
Iterate.

That's the roadmap.
