# Why Treasury Automation Matters

Manual treasury management is error-prone, time-consuming, and doesn't scale. Here's why automation is the future.

## The Problem with Manual Processes

Traditional multisig wallets require manual coordination for every payment. Budgets are tracked in spreadsheets. Spending caps aren't enforced—they're just guidelines.

### Key Issues:
- Manual coordination for every payment
- Budget tracking is error-prone
- No automatic audit trail
- Trust is social, not technical

## How FlowGuard Solves This

FlowGuard automates treasury operations while maintaining security and transparency.

### Automated Enforcement
Set the rules once, and the blockchain enforces them automatically. Spending caps that can't be exceeded. Approval requirements that can't be bypassed.

### Scheduled Payments
Payments happen on schedule without manual intervention. Vesting unlocks automatically. Payroll runs on time.

### Complete Transparency
All activity is publicly visible on the blockchain. Anyone can audit treasury operations.

## Real-World Use Cases

### DAO Treasury Management
Automate contributor payments, enforce spending limits, and maintain transparent operations.

### Token Vesting
Release tokens to team members and investors on a fixed schedule with no manual intervention.

### Grant Programs
Distribute funds to multiple recipients efficiently with automated execution.
