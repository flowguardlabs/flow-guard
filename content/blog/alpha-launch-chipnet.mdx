# FlowGuard Alpha Launches on BCH Chipnet

We're excited to announce the alpha release of FlowGuard on Bitcoin Cash Chipnet. FlowGuard brings automated treasury management with on-chain enforcement to Bitcoin Cash.

## What is FlowGuard?

FlowGuard is a protocol for guaranteed, permissionless fund movement on BCH. It allows organizations to:

- **Automate payments** on fixed schedules
- **Enforce spending limits** that cannot be bypassed
- **Require approvals** for large expenses
- **Track all activity** transparently on-chain

## Key Features

### Treasury Management
Create multi-signature treasuries with customizable rules. Set spending limits, approval workflows, and automated controls.

### Vesting Schedules
Release tokens on a fixed schedule with customizable cliffs and unlock periods.

### Recurring Payments
Execute one-time or recurring payments with automated scheduling.

### Governance
On-chain governance with configurable voting rules for democratic decision-making.

## What's Next

We're focused on gathering feedback from early users and preparing for mainnet launch. Key milestones include:

- External security audits
- Beta testing program
- Mainnet deployment (post-audit)
- Advanced features leveraging May 2026 BCHN Layla upgrade

## Get Started

Connect your BCH wallet and create your first treasury on Chipnet. We recommend using Paytaca wallet for the best experience.
