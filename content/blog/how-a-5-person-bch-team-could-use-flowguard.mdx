# How a 5-Person BCH Team Could Use FlowGuard in Practice

## Introduction

It's easy to describe features in isolation:

- Vaults.
- Streams.
- Budgets.
- Governance.

But what does this look like in a real scenario?

Let's walk through a practical example using Bitcoin Cash.

## The Scenario

A 5-person BCH development team:

- Treasury: 50 BCH
- 3 core maintainers
- 2 part-time contributors
- Monthly payroll
- 1 external grant recipient

Goals:

- No single person controls funds
- Monthly spending discipline
- Structured salary distribution
- Milestone-based grant release
- Transparent governance

## Step 1: Deploy the Vault

The team creates a vault with:

- 3-of-5 approval threshold
- 30-day cycle duration
- 10 BCH unlock per cycle
- 3 BCH per-transaction cap

What this enforces:

- At least 3 signers must approve
- Only 10 BCH can be spent per month
- No single payout exceeds 3 BCH

Even if all signers agree to spend 20 BCH in one month, the contract rejects it.

Spending discipline is enforced.

## Step 2: Set Up Salary Streams

Each contributor receives a vesting stream:

Example:

- Contributor A → 2 BCH/month
- Contributor B → 1 BCH/month
- Contributor C → 0.5 BCH/month

Each stream:

- Uses NFT commitment state
- Tracks total released
- Updates on each claim
- Prevents over-withdrawal

Contributors claim their vested amounts directly from the contract.

No one manually sends payroll each month.

## Step 3: Add a Milestone-Based Grant

The team funds an external developer:

- Total: 6 BCH
- Duration: 3 months
- 2 BCH unlocked per milestone

The budget contract enforces:

- Month 1 unlock → 2 BCH
- Month 2 unlock → 2 BCH
- Month 3 unlock → 2 BCH

Funds cannot be released early.

No admin decides release timing.

Time and rules enforce it.

## Step 4: Governance for Large Changes

Suppose the team wants to:

- Increase spending cap
- Add a new signer
- Approve a large strategic payout

This requires:

- Token locking
- Vote threshold
- Tally validation

If quorum and majority are not met, the proposal cannot execute.

Treasury movement becomes conditional on governance outcome.

## What This Prevents

This structure prevents:

- One signer draining treasury
- Overspending in a single month
- Manual salary errors
- Grant over-release
- Governance bypass

It removes ambiguity from treasury management.

## Transparency

Because this runs on Bitcoin Cash:

- Vault address is public
- Stream contracts are public
- Unlock schedules are visible
- Claims are verifiable

Anyone can inspect treasury behavior.

This builds ecosystem trust.

## What This Changes

Without structure:

Treasury management depends on coordination.

With FlowGuard:

Treasury management becomes enforceable infrastructure.

The team still debates decisions.

But once rules are set, execution follows logic.

## Scaling Beyond 5 People

This model scales to:

- Larger DAOs
- Grant programs
- Hackathon prize pools
- Public ecosystem funds

The same primitives apply:

Vault → Streams → Budgets → Governance.

## Closing

This isn't theory.

This is how a BCH-native team could manage real capital using enforceable treasury rules.

FlowGuard doesn't replace discussion.

It replaces ambiguity at execution time.

Next, we'll close the series with the post-sprint roadmap and long-term direction.
