# FlowGuard End-to-End Testing on Bitcoin Cash Chipnet

## Introduction

It's easy to build a clean UI.

It's harder to prove that the system actually works on-chain.

FlowGuard has been tested end-to-end on the Bitcoin Cash Chipnet test network.

This post explains what that means — and what was actually executed.

## What "End-to-End" Means

End-to-end testing covers the full lifecycle:

- Contract deployment
- Contract funding
- Transaction building
- Wallet signing
- Broadcast to network
- On-chain validation
- State updates
- Explorer verification

If any part fails, the flow is incomplete.

We tested complete flows.

## Vault Lifecycle Test

The vault lifecycle included:

- Deploying VaultCovenant
- Encoding constructor parameters
- Funding the vault with BCH
- Creating proposals
- Approving proposals (M-of-N signatures)
- Executing payouts

Validation checks enforced:

- Approval threshold
- Spending cap
- Cycle unlock rules

Transactions were signed via wallet and verified on the network.

## Stream Lifecycle Test

Streams were tested using NFT commitment state.

Tested flows included:

- Deploying VestingCovenant
- Funding with BCH and NFT commitment
- Claiming partial vested amounts
- Updating commitment state
- Preventing over-claim attempts

Each claim transaction:

- Calculated vested amount
- Updated NFT commitment
- Preserved remaining balance

All enforced by covenant logic.

## Proposal Execution Flow

Governance-connected flows tested:

- Proposal creation
- Approval accumulation
- Execution attempt before threshold (fail case)
- Execution after threshold (success case)

This confirmed:

- Threshold enforcement
- Cap enforcement
- Contract-level validation

Invalid transactions were rejected as expected.

## Budget Unlock Testing

Milestone-based unlock flows tested:

- Attempted early unlock (rejected)
- Unlock after timestamp passed (accepted)
- Over-release attempt (rejected)

This validated:

- Time-based enforcement
- Allocation boundaries
- Deterministic state transitions

## Non-Custodial Confirmation

At no point did:

- The backend sign transactions
- A private key leave the wallet
- A database override on-chain rules

The pattern remained consistent:

Backend builds template → Wallet signs → Blockchain validates

If validation fails, the transaction never confirms.

## Why Chipnet Testing Matters

Chipnet testing verifies:

- Real covenant execution
- CashTokens compatibility
- Transaction fee behavior
- UTXO state updates
- Explorer visibility

It proves the contracts function under network conditions.

This is different from:

- Simulated logic
- Hardcoded mock states
- Off-chain execution demos

## Transparency

All transactions can be inspected via BCH explorers.

- Contract addresses exist.
- Funding transactions exist.
- Claim transactions exist.
- State transitions are visible in UTXOs.

Testing is not theoretical.

It is observable.

## What This Proves

FlowGuard is:

- Not database-driven
- Not admin-controlled
- Not dependent on manual reconciliation

It is covenant-enforced treasury logic operating on Bitcoin Cash.

Testing confirms that the enforcement holds under live conditions.

## What Comes Next

Chipnet testing is the foundation.

Next steps before mainnet:

- Final UX refinements
- Security audit
- Production deployment
- First live DAO treasury

FlowGuard is not a sprint submission artifact.

It is being built for long-term BCH ecosystem use.

## Closing

Infrastructure must be tested where it runs.

FlowGuard contracts have been executed on-chain.

Rules were validated by consensus.

Transactions were verifiable.

That is the standard treasury infrastructure requires.
