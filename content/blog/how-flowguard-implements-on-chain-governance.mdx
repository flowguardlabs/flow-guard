# How FlowGuard Implements On-Chain Governance on Bitcoin Cash

## Introduction

Governance is often treated as a signaling mechanism.

Projects run:

- Off-chain polls
- Snapshot votes
- Community surveys

Then someone manually executes the outcome.

This creates a gap:

The vote may pass, but execution still depends on trust.

FlowGuard closes that gap by implementing governance logic directly on Bitcoin Cash.

Voting is enforced.
Execution is conditional.
Treasury actions depend on contract validation.

## The Core Components

FlowGuard governance is built around three elements:

- Token locking
- Vote recording
- Tally validation

Each step is enforced by covenant contracts.

## 1. Token Locking

To vote, tokens must be locked.

This prevents:

- Flash voting
- Temporary borrowing for voting power
- Double-use of tokens

The locking contract verifies:

- Token ownership
- Lock duration
- Voting eligibility

Locked tokens remain inaccessible until the voting period ends.

Voting power equals locked amount.

## 2. Vote Recording

When a voter casts a vote:

- Their locked tokens are referenced
- Their vote choice is recorded
- The contract validates eligibility

Votes cannot exceed the locked amount.

Votes cannot be cast after the deadline.

The blockchain enforces voting period rules.

## 3. Tally Commitment

At the end of the voting period:

- Votes are tallied
- A tally commitment is generated
- Execution is allowed only if conditions are met

This includes:

- Minimum quorum
- Required majority
- Time-based restrictions

If a proposal fails quorum, execution is impossible.

If it passes, execution becomes valid.

## Connecting Governance to Treasury

The important part:

Governance is not isolated.

Proposals can trigger:

- Vault payouts
- Budget releases
- Parameter updates

Execution of treasury actions depends on governance outcome.

This prevents:

- Manual bypass
- Off-chain reinterpretation
- Silent policy changes

If governance fails, treasury cannot move.

## Example Scenario

Imagine:

- A treasury proposal to release 5 BCH for development
- Voting period: 7 days
- Minimum quorum: 30%
- Majority required: >50%

If after 7 days:

- Quorum not met → execution invalid
- Majority not achieved → execution invalid
- Both satisfied → execution allowed

The contract enforces the result.

No one "decides" afterward.

## Why This Matters

Without enforcement:

Votes are advisory.

With covenant enforcement:

Votes become binding.

This is important for:

- DAO-managed treasuries
- Community funding
- Long-term ecosystem governance
- Grant review processes

Execution follows validation, not interpretation.

## BCH-Specific Advantage

Because Bitcoin Cash supports:

- Covenant logic
- Native token locking
- Deterministic validation

Governance can be integrated directly with treasury contracts.

This avoids:

- Separate governance tokens on another chain
- Off-chain tally infrastructure
- Centralized execution services

Everything stays inside the BCH ecosystem.

## What Governance Does Not Mean

Governance does not remove:

- Disagreement
- Debate
- Community discussion

It removes ambiguity at execution time.

Once rules are defined and encoded, the outcome is deterministic.

## Closing

FlowGuard governance turns voting from:

"Community sentiment"

into

"Enforceable treasury action."

Tokens are locked.
Votes are validated.
Tally determines execution.
Contracts enforce the outcome.

In the next post, we'll move from mechanics to proof — how FlowGuard is tested end-to-end on Chipnet and verifiable on-chain.
