/**
 * Frontend/backend network agreement check.
 *
 * Neither side supports runtime network switching: the frontend bakes
 * `VITE_BCH_NETWORK` in at build time (`useNetwork()`) and the backend reads
 * `BCH_NETWORK` from the process env at boot (`resolveBchNetwork()`). A mismatch is
 * silent and expensive — the app renders chipnet UI while the backend builds mainnet
 * transactions against real UTXOs, or the reverse, and the first symptom is a wallet
 * prompt for a transaction that cannot possibly confirm.
 *
 * `GET /api/status` reports the backend's resolved network as `network.name`, so a
 * single unauthenticated call settles it.
 *
 * Fail-open on anything inconclusive (offline, 500, unexpected shape) and fail-closed
 * only on a definite disagreement: an unreachable status endpoint must not block a
 * user whose configuration is fine.
