The Explorer provides a public, unified view across all FlowGuard activity — vesting streams, recurring payments, airdrops, and treasury proposals.

## Activity Feed

```http
GET /api/explorer/activity
```

Returns a merged, time-sorted list of activity across all product types.

**Query parameters**

| Parameter | Values | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `type` | `vesting`, `payments`, `airdrops`, `treasuries` | Filter to a single product type. Omit for all. |
| `token` | `BCH`, `FUNGIBLE_TOKEN`, `ALL` | Filter by asset type. |
| `status` | `ACTIVE`, `PENDING`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED` | Filter by status. |
| `limit` | 1–200 (default 50) | Max records to return. |

**Response**
```json
{
  "streams": [
    {
      "id": "...",
      "stream_id": "#FG-STREAM-001",
      "sender": "bchtest:q...",
      "recipient": "bchtest:q...",
      "token_type": "BCH",
      "total_amount": 10.0,
      "vested_amount": 4.5,
      "progress_percentage": 45,
      "stream_type": "LINEAR",
      "status": "ACTIVE",
      "created_at": 1700000000,
      "activity_type": "STREAM"
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "totalVolume": 125000,
    "activeCount": 18,
    "completedCount": 7,
    "totalCount": 25
  }
}
```

Each row in `streams` includes an `activity_type` field set to `STREAM`, `PAYMENT`, `AIRDROP`, or `TREASURY` indicating the source product.

<Note>
Additional explorer/read-model endpoints are available under `/api/explorer/*` (for example stats, timeline, search, and contract/address lookups). Operator health for indexing is exposed at `/api/admin/indexer/*`.
