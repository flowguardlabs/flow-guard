FlowGuard includes an executor scaffold in `backend/executor/` for automated task polling and transaction construction.

## Important Scope Note

There is currently no public, stable REST API for the executor service itself. It is an internal/prototype worker process, not a customer-facing endpoint set.

## What Exists Today

- Executor codebase: `backend/executor/`
- Poll loop and task scanning scaffolding
- Transaction builder scaffolding for schedule/proposal flows
- Environment-driven configuration

## Prototype Configuration

The executor currently reads these environment values:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection |
| `NETWORK` | `chipnet` or `mainnet` |
| `ELECTRUM_SERVER` | Electrum server hostname |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | Poll interval in ms |
| `MAX_GAS_PRICE` | Fee ceiling used by builder |
| `EXECUTOR_PRIVATE_KEY` | Optional executor signing key |

## Production Guidance

- Do not assume autonomous payout execution unless your own deployment has validated and enabled executor behavior.
- Treat executor automation as optional infrastructure that must be operated and monitored by your team.
- Always preserve manual claim/execute paths in UI and ops playbooks.
