FlowGuard currently exposes indexer visibility through backend admin routes.

## Current Production Endpoints

```http
GET /api/admin/indexer/status
GET /api/admin/indexer/errors
POST /api/admin/indexer/resync
```

These routes provide operator-facing health/sync metadata for the running backend.

## Current State of the Separate Indexer Service

A separate service scaffold exists in `backend/indexer/`, but it is still an evolving component and should be treated as prototype infrastructure unless you explicitly harden and run it yourself.

What is true today:

- Core app flows (`/api/streams`, `/api/payments`, `/api/airdrops`, etc.) operate from the main backend database.
- Admin indexer status routes are available from the main backend.
- The standalone indexer package exists but is not a drop-in production requirement for normal app usage.

## Recommended Usage

- Use `/api/admin/indexer/status` for operational monitoring.
- Treat standalone indexer endpoints as custom/self-hosted engineering work until your deployment team validates them.

## Environment Notes

For local experimentation with indexer components, you will typically configure:

- `BCH_NETWORK`
- `DATABASE_URL` (for Postgres-backed indexer experiments)

Keep these separate from the default SQLite-backed backend setup unless you are intentionally running a multi-service architecture.
