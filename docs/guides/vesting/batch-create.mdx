Batch creation deploys multiple covenant UTXOs in a coordinated sequence from a single vault. This is useful for:

- Onboarding multiple team members with individual vesting schedules
- Setting up DAO contributor payments in bulk
- Distributing a grant to multiple recipients simultaneously

## How to Batch Create

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Batch Create">
    Go to **Vault → Batch Create Streams**, or navigate to **Streams → Batch Create**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build recipient list">
    Add each row to the recipient table:

    | Field | Description |
    |-|-|
    | Recipient Address | BCH P2PKH address |
    | Amount | Total tokens for this recipient |
    | Start Date | Vesting or payment start |
    | End Date | Vesting end (ignored for recurring payments) |
    | Cliff Date | Optional, vesting only |
    | Schedule Type | Linear, Step, or Recurring |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review summary">
    The batch summary shows total funds required from the vault. Confirm the vault has sufficient balance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Each recipient's covenant is deployed as a separate on-chain transaction. Transactions are batched and submitted sequentially. The dashboard displays progress as each confirms.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
The vault balance must cover the total of all streams in the batch. Ensure the vault is funded before initiating a batch deployment.
</Warning>

## Current Limitations

Pre-Loops CHIP, each covenant UTXO is a separate transaction. A batch of 10 streams requires 10 transactions. The FlowGuard app sequences these automatically, but confirmation time scales linearly with batch size.

Post-Loops CHIP, a single transaction will be able to deploy multiple covenant UTXOs simultaneously.
