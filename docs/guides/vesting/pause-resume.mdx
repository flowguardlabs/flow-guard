The sender can pause a vesting stream at any time to temporarily freeze vesting. Paused time is excluded from all future vesting calculations.

## Pause

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the stream">
    Go to **Streams** and select the active stream.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Pause">
    Click **Pause Stream**. Sign the transaction with the sender wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="What happens on-chain">
    The `pause_start` field in the NFT commitment is set to `tx.locktime`. Status changes to `PAUSED`. No tokens are moved.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Pause requires `FLAG_CANCELABLE` (`0x01`) to be set on the stream. Non-cancelable streams cannot be paused.
</Note>

## Resume

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Resume">
    On the stream detail page, click **Resume Stream**. Sign with the sender wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="What happens on-chain">
    The `cursor` advances by the pause duration:

    ```
    newCursor = cursor + (tx.locktime - pause_start)
    ```

    `pause_start` is reset to `0`. Status returns to `ACTIVE`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Effect on Vesting Math

After resume, all vesting calculations use the updated `cursor` instead of the original `startTimestamp`:

```
elapsed     = tx.locktime - cursor   # cursor has absorbed pause duration
vestedTotal = (totalAmount × elapsed) / duration
claimable   = vestedTotal - totalReleased
```

The recipient receives the same total amount — only the duration shifts forward.

## Example

| Event | Time | Cursor | Vested |
|-|-|-|-|
| Deploy | T=0 | T=0 | 0% |
| 6 months pass | T=6m | T=0 | 50% |
| Pause | T=6m | T=0 | 50% |
| 3 months paused | — | — | 50% (frozen) |
| Resume | T=9m | T=3m | 50% (as if T=6m) |
| 6 more months | T=15m | T=3m | 100% |

The total vesting duration is 12 months of active time, as originally configured.
