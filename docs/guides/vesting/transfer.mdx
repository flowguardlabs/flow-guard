description: "How a vesting stream recipient reassigns the stream to a new address."

If a vesting stream was created with `FLAG_TRANSFERABLE`, the current recipient can reassign it to any new address. The sender has no role in this operation.

<Note>
Transfer requires `FLAG_TRANSFERABLE` (`0x02`) to be set. If this flag is not present, the recipient is immutable for the lifetime of the stream.
</Note>

## transferring

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the stream">
    Navigate to **Streams** and select the stream.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Transfer">
    Click **Transfer Stream**. Enter the new recipient's BCH P2PKH address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign with current recipient wallet">
    The current recipient must sign. The contract validates:
    - `hash160(recipientPubkey) == recipient_hash` (from NFT state)
    - `status == ACTIVE`
    - `FLAG_TRANSFERABLE` is set
  </Step>
  <Step title="On-chain result">
    The NFT `recipient_hash` field is updated to the new `hash160`. All future `claim()` calls must be signed by the new recipient. Prior claimed amounts are unaffected.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Gets Transferred

- **Entitlement to all future claims** — the new recipient can claim all tokens that vest from this point forward, plus any previously vested but unclaimed tokens.

## What Is Not Transferred

- **Already-claimed tokens** — those were already paid to the original recipient and are settled.
