<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Grants">
    Open a Vault and go to **Grants → New Grant**, or use **Grants → New Grant** in the main sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the recipient">
    Enter the contractor's BCH P2PKH address and an optional display label.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define milestones">
    Add one or more milestones. Each milestone has:
    - **Amount**: BCH or token amount released at this milestone
    - **Duration**: seconds from the previous milestone (or `startDate` for the first) before funds can be released
    - **Description**: optional label (e.g. "Design phase", "Beta delivery")

    The total grant amount is the sum of all milestone amounts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure options">
    - **Token**: BCH or CashToken (provide token category)
    - **Cancelable**: whether unreleased milestones can be reclaimed by the controller
    - **Start date**: Unix timestamp for when the first milestone clock begins
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy and fund">
    Click **Create Grant**. The backend deploys the BudgetCovenant and returns a funding `wcTransaction`. Sign it in your wallet. After broadcasting, click **Confirm Funding** with the transaction hash.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Milestone Clock

After funding, the first milestone unlocks after `milestones[0].durationSeconds` from `startDate`. Each subsequent milestone unlocks after its `durationSeconds` from the moment the previous one was released.

## Recipient Experience

The recipient sees the grant under their **Receiving → Grants** tab. When a milestone is due, they click **Release** and sign the transaction. Multiple elapsed milestones can be batched into one transaction.
