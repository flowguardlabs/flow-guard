<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the bounty">
    Navigate to **Bounties → Receiving** and click on the bounty you completed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the lock to expire">
    The bounty detail page shows a countdown to the unlock time. The covenant enforces this time on-chain — the **Claim** button remains disabled until `current_blocktime >= startTime + lockDuration`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim">
    Once unlocked, click **Claim Bounty**. The app calls `POST /api/budget-plans/:id/release` with your recipient address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign">
    Your wallet displays the transaction. Sign and broadcast.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    The app automatically calls `POST /api/budget-plans/:id/confirm-release`. The funds arrive in your wallet and the bounty status updates to `COMPLETED`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cancellation During Lock Period

If the funder created the bounty with `cancelable: true`, they can cancel before you claim. You will see a **"Bounty cancelled"** notice and no funds will be transferred to your address. Contact the funder to resolve any dispute off-chain.

## Partial Claims Not Supported

Bounties have a single milestone. Either you claim the full amount, or you do not claim at all. If you need partial payouts, ask the funder to set up a multi-milestone Grant instead.
