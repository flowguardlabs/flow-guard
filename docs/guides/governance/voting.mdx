## Approving a Proposal

When a proposal is created on-chain, each vault signer receives a notification. Each signer approves independently:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the proposal">
    Navigate to **Governance → Proposals** in the vault and click the pending proposal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve on-chain">
    Click **Approve**. The app calls `POST /api/:id/approve-onchain`. Sign the approval `wcTransaction` in your wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    After broadcasting, the app calls `POST /api/:id/confirm-approval`. Your address is added to the `approvals` list. When 2 of 3 signers approve, the proposal moves to `approved`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Executing the Payout

Once the proposal is `approved`, any of the 2 signers who approved can initiate execution:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate execute">
    Click **Execute Payout**. The app calls `POST /api/:id/execute`. The backend selects the 2-signer pair and returns a `wcTransaction` with `"broadcast": false`. Sign but do **not** broadcast yet — the wallet knows to hold the signed transaction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit signature">
    Call `POST /api/:id/execute-signature` with the `sessionId` and your `signedTransaction`. The first signer submits their partial signature.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second signer signs">
    The second required signer opens the same proposal, clicks **Execute Payout**, and submits their signature via `execute-signature`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-broadcast">
    Once the second signature arrives, the backend validates both signatures, broadcasts the fully-signed transaction, and marks the proposal `executed`. Funds appear in the recipient's wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rejection

FlowGuard does not have an explicit reject action. If a proposal does not reach quorum before `voting_end_timestamp`, anyone can call `expire()` and move it to `EXPIRED` on-chain.
