This flow covers signer-governed treasury payout proposals. The lifecycle is: create proposal record, deploy ProposalCovenant, collect signer approvals, then execute payout.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the vault">
    Navigate to **Vaults → [your vault] → Governance → New Proposal**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the proposal">
    - **Recipient**: BCH address that will receive the funds
    - **Amount**: BCH amount requested
    - **Reason**: rationale and supporting context
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit off-chain">
    Click **Create Proposal**. This calls `POST /api/vaults/:vaultId/proposals` and creates the database record with `status: pending`. No on-chain transaction yet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create on-chain proposal">
    Click **Fund Proposal On-chain**. The app calls `POST /api/:id/create-onchain`, which deploys the ProposalCovenant and returns a `wcTransaction`. Sign it in your wallet to lock the proposal's payout amount in the covenant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    After the wallet broadcasts, the app calls `POST /api/:id/confirm-create`. The proposal status becomes `pending` and signers are notified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Approval Flow

Each of the 3 vault signers individually approves the proposal by calling `POST /api/:id/approve-onchain` (or clicking **Approve** in the UI). When 2 of 3 sign, the proposal moves to `approved` and is ready for execution.

See [Voting on Proposals](/guides/governance/voting) for the approval and execution guide.
