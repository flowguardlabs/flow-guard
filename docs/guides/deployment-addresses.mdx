<Warning>
Addresses are deterministic from the contract bytecode and deployment parameters. Always verify the address you are interacting with against the expected bytecode hash for the parameters you configured.
</Warning>

## How Addresses Are Derived

FlowGuard contracts compile to P2SH32 addresses. Each unique combination of constructor parameters produces a unique address. Two vesting covenants with different `totalAmount` values will have different addresses.

The `DeploymentRegistryService` in the backend tracks all addresses deployed through FlowGuard along with the parameters used.

## Mainnet

| Contract | Version | Address |
|-|-|-|
| VaultCovenant | v1.0 | See deployment registry |
| VestingCovenant | v1.0 | Per-deployment (parameterized) |
| RecurringPaymentCovenant | v1.0 | Per-deployment (parameterized) |
| AirdropCovenant | v1.0 | Per-deployment (parameterized) |
| GrantCovenant | v1.0 | Per-deployment (parameterized) |
| BountyCovenant | v1.0 | Per-deployment (parameterized) |
| RewardCovenant | v1.0 | Per-deployment (parameterized) |
| ProposalCovenant | v1.0 | Per-deployment (parameterized) |
| VoteLockCovenant | v1.0 | Per-deployment (parameterized) |

<Info>
Because each covenant is parameterized at deploy time, there is no single canonical address for most contracts. Use `GET /api/deployment/registry` to list tracked deployments.
</Info>

## Chipnet (Testing)

Chipnet deployments are tracked separately in `flowguard-chipnet.db`. Use the API with `BCH_NETWORK=chipnet` to query chipnet deployments.

## Verify a Contract

To verify that a given BCH address corresponds to a FlowGuard covenant with specific parameters:

```bash
curl https://api.flowguard.cash/api/deployment/verify/<address>
```

The response includes the contract type, version, parameters, and the bytecode hash used to derive the address.
