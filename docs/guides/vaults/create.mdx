<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Vaults">
    Connect your wallet and go to **Vaults → Create Vault** in the dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure signers">
    Enter the `hash160` (P2PKH) addresses of up to 3 signers. Set `Required Approvals` to the M value (1, 2, or 3).

    | Setup | Required Approvals | Signers |
    |-|-|-|
    | Solo treasury | 1 | 1 address |
    | 2-of-3 DAO | 2 | 3 addresses |
    | 3-of-3 strict | 3 | 3 addresses |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set spending controls (optional)">
    - **Period Duration**: seconds per rolling spending window (e.g. `2592000` = 30 days). Set `0` to disable.
    - **Period Cap**: max satoshis spendable per period. Set `0` for unlimited.
    - **Recipient Cap**: max satoshis per individual spend. Set `0` for unlimited.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure allowlist (optional)">
    Enable **Allowlist** and enter up to 3 recipient P2PKH addresses. When enabled, `spend()` will reject any recipient not in the list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Click **Create Vault**. Sign the deployment transaction. The vault UTXO appears in your Vaults list once the transaction confirms.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The vault `vaultId` is generated from the deployment transaction hash. Keep a record of it — you will reference it when creating covenants from this vault.
