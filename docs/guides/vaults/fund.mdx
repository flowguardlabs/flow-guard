      <Tab title="Fund with BCH">
        Enter the amount in BCH. The transaction sends BCH directly into the vault UTXO, increasing its value without changing any NFT state fields.

      <Tab title="Fund with CashToken">
        Select the token category you want to deposit. Ensure the token matches the `FLAG_USES_TOKENS` configuration of the covenant you plan to create from this vault.

  <Step title="Confirm and sign">
    Sign the funding transaction. The vault balance updates in the dashboard after one confirmation.

## API

```bash
POST /api/vaults/:id/fund
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 500000000,
  "assetType": "BCH"
}
```

<Info>
The vault UTXO holds the entire balance. Each child covenant (stream, airdrop, etc.) withdraws directly from the vault balance during deployment. Ensure the vault holds sufficient funds before creating covenants.
