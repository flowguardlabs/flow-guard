## Monitoring Claims

Open your campaign from **Airdrops → My Campaigns**. The detail page shows:

- **Claimed**: number of wallets that have claimed so far
- **Total recipients**: either the merkle tree size or `totalAmount / amountPerClaim`
- **Claimed amount**: BCH or tokens distributed
- **Remaining**: funds still locked in the contract

The claim list below shows each claimer address, amount, timestamp, and transaction hash.

## Pausing a Campaign

Click **Pause** on the campaign detail page. The app calls `POST /api/airdrops/:id/pause` and returns a `wcTransaction`. Sign it in your wallet, then confirm with `POST /api/airdrops/:id/confirm-pause`.

While paused, the `/claim` endpoint returns a `400` and the claim button is disabled in the UI.

## Resume Availability

`resume` is implemented at the covenant level, but the current backend release does not expose `/api/airdrops/:id/resume` and `/confirm-resume`. Plan pause/cancel flows accordingly.

## Cancelling

Click **Cancel**. The cancel transaction withdraws all remaining unclaimed funds back to the creator's address. Confirmed via `POST /api/airdrops/:id/confirm-cancel`. The campaign transitions to `CANCELLED` and is removed from public listings.

<Warning>
Once cancelled, the remaining funds return to your wallet. Already-confirmed claims are unaffected.
</Warning>

## CSV Export

Click **Export claims** to download a CSV of all claim records (`claimer, amount, tx_hash, claimed_at`).
