<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the claim link">
    Click the campaign's claim link, or navigate directly to `/claim/{token}` in the FlowGuard app. The app resolves the token to the campaign via `GET /api/airdrops/claim/:token`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your wallet">
    If you are not already connected, the page will prompt you to connect via WalletConnect v2. Your address is used to check eligibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check eligibility">
    For open campaigns, all addresses are eligible. For KYC-restricted campaigns, the app fetches your merkle proof via `GET /api/airdrops/:id/proof/:address`. If you are not in the merkle tree, you will see an ineligibility notice.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim">
    Click **Claim**. The app calls `POST /api/airdrops/:id/claim` with your address. The backend validates eligibility and co-signs with the campaign claim-authority key, then your wallet signs as claimer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    After your wallet broadcasts, the app automatically calls `POST /api/airdrops/:id/confirm-claim`. Your claimed amount appears in your wallet within seconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
KYC/whitelist eligibility is currently enforced in backend claim building (`/api/airdrops/:id/claim`) using stored merkle data. The on-chain `AirdropCovenant` itself enforces fixed claim math and state transitions.
</Note>

## Claim Limits

Each campaign has a `maxClaimsPerAddress` setting (default 1). If you have already reached the limit, the claim button is disabled and a message indicates when the limit was reached.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "Campaign not active" | Campaign is paused or not yet started | Wait for the creator to resume or the start date to arrive |
| "Address not eligible" | KYC campaign — address not in whitelist | Contact the campaign creator |
| "Claim limit reached" | Already claimed the maximum allowed | No further action available |
| Transaction fails | Insufficient BCH for fees | Top up your wallet with Chipnet test BCH |
