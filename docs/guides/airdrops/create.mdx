<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Airdrops">
    Go to **Airdrops → New Campaign** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the campaign">
    Fill in the campaign details:
    - **Title**: public campaign name
    - **Token**: BCH or a CashToken (requires the 32-byte `tokenCategory` hex)
    - **Total amount**: full pool to distribute
    - **Amount per claim**: how much each wallet receives per claim
    - **Max claims per address**: defaults to 1
    - **Start / End dates**: optional claim window
    - **KYC restricted**: enable to require a recipient whitelist
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate merkle tree (KYC only)">
    If KYC is enabled, upload a CSV with `address,amount` rows. The app calls `POST /api/airdrops/:id/generate-merkle` and stores merkle data in backend campaign state for eligibility checks during claim build.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fund the contract">
    Click **Fund**. The app calls `GET /api/airdrops/:id/funding-info` to build the funding `wcTransaction`. Sign in your wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm funding">
    After your wallet broadcasts, the app calls `POST /api/airdrops/:id/confirm-funding`. Once the on-chain output is verified, the campaign status changes to `ACTIVE`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share the claim link">
    Copy the auto-generated claim link from the campaign detail page and share it. Recipients visit the link and claim with a single wallet signature.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Airdrop Lifecycle

```
PENDING → ACTIVE → PAUSED → ACTIVE → COMPLETED / CANCELLED
```

The campaign becomes `COMPLETED` when all tokens are claimed. It moves to `CANCELLED` when the creator cancels and withdraws remaining funds.

<Note>
Current KYC enforcement is handled by backend claim validation (merkle proof checks before tx build), not by a merkle root field enforced inside `AirdropCovenant` bytecode.
</Note>
