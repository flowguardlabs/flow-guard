The `pay()` function on `RecurringPaymentCovenant` is **permissionless**. Any party can call it when the interval has elapsed. The contract enforces correctness — the caller cannot alter the amount or recipient.

## When Can pay() Be Called?

```
require(tx.locktime >= next_payment_timestamp)
require(status == ACTIVE)
```

The executor service monitors `next_payment_timestamp` for all active payments and submits `pay()` transactions automatically. You can also trigger payment manually from the app.

## Triggering Manually (Current API)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the payment">
    Navigate to **Payments** and select the payment. The detail page shows **Next Payment Due** and whether it is currently claimable.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Claim Payment">
    If an interval is due, the **Claim Payment** button is active. The recipient wallet signs the transaction.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What the Transaction Produces

A valid `pay()` transaction:
1. Releases `amountPerInterval` to `recipientHash`
2. Advances `next_payment_timestamp` by `intervalSeconds`
3. Increments `payment_count`
4. Adds `amountPerInterval` to `total_paid`
5. Auto-completes if `total_paid >= totalAmount` (when capped)

## Executor Automation

The FlowGuard executor service polls all active payments and triggers `pay()` as each interval elapses. No action is needed from the sender or recipient. See [Executor Network](/concepts/executor-network) for details.

## API (Current)

```bash
POST /api/payments/:id/claim
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "recipientAddress": "bchtest:q..."
}

# Response
{
  "success": true,
  "claimableAmount": 0.1,
  "intervalsClaimable": 1,
  "wcTransaction": { ... }
}
```

After wallet broadcast:

```bash
POST /api/payments/:id/confirm-claim
```
