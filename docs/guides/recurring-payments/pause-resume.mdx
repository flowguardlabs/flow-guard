The sender can pause a recurring payment to temporarily suspend payouts. The executor will not trigger `pay()` while the payment is paused.

## Pause

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the payment">
    Navigate to **Payments** and select the active payment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Pause">
    Click **Pause**. Sign with the sender wallet. Status changes to `PAUSED` on-chain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Pause requires `FLAG_CANCELABLE` to be set. Non-cancelable payments cannot be paused.
</Note>

## Resume

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Resume">
    From the paused payment, click **Resume**. Sign with the sender wallet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="On-chain behavior">
    `next_payment_timestamp` is reset to `tx.locktime + intervalSeconds`. No backdated intervals are paid for the pause period. The payment schedule continues from the resume time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Backdated Payments

FlowGuard does not backfill missed intervals during a pause. If you pause for three weeks and resume, the next payment is due one interval after the resume time — not three weeks earlier.

This matches the expected behavior for employment payroll: paused periods are unpaid.
