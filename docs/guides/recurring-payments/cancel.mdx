Cancelling a recurring payment returns the entire remaining pool to the sender. Any amount already paid to the recipient is settled — only the unpaid remainder returns.

<Note>
Cancel requires `FLAG_CANCELABLE`. If the payment was deployed without this flag, neither sender nor anyone else can cancel it.
</Note>

## How to Cancel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the payment">
    Navigate to **Payments** and find the active or paused payment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Cancel">
    Click **Cancel Payment**. The preview shows the remaining pool amount that will return to the sender.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign and confirm">
    Sign with the sender wallet. The covenant UTXO is consumed. The remaining pool is sent to the sender's address in the same transaction. No NFT output is produced — the payment is terminated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Unlimited Streams

For streams deployed with `totalAmount = 0`, the remaining pool is the entire current BCH or token balance of the UTXO at cancel time.
