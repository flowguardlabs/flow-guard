## Viewing Outstanding Rewards

When funded, a reward appears in the recipient's **Receiving** dashboard. Each card shows:

- Who issued the reward
- Amount and asset type
- Whether it is immediately claimable or has a lock countdown

## Claiming an Immediate Reward

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the reward">
    Click the reward card in **Rewards → Receiving**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim">
    Click **Claim Reward**. The sign prompt appears in your wallet immediately — there is no waiting period for immediate rewards.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    After broadcasting, the reward is marked claimed and the amount appears in your on-chain balance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Claiming a Deferred Reward

The claim button is disabled with a countdown timer until the `releaseAfter` timestamp is reached. Once unlocked, the same claim flow applies.

## Multiple Outstanding Rewards

Each reward is a separate covenant. Claim them individually. There is no batch-claim across different reward contracts.

## Reward vs. Stream vs. Airdrop

| Product | Use case |
|---------|----------|
| Reward | One-time payout to one person |
| Stream | Continuous vesting to one person over time |
| Airdrop | Same amount to many people at once |
