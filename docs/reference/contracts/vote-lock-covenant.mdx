`VoteLockCovenant` locks governance FTs with an immutable vote choice. The UTXO model eliminates double-voting cryptographically.

**Contract path:** `contracts/core/governance/VoteLockCovenant.cash`

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `proposalId` | `bytes32` | Links vote to specific proposal |
| `voteChoice` | `int` | `0` = AGAINST, `1` = FOR, `2` = ABSTAIN |
| `voterHash` | `bytes20` | `hash160(voter pubkey)` — only owner can reclaim |
| `unlockTimestamp` | `int` | When tokens can be reclaimed |

## NFT State (32 bytes)

```
[0]:    version
[1-4]:  proposal_id_prefix (first 4 bytes of proposalId)
[5]:    vote_choice
[6-7]:  reserved
[8-12]: lock_timestamp (5 bytes)
[13-17]: unlock_timestamp (5 bytes)
[18-31]: reserved
```

## Functions

### `reclaim(sig voterSig, pubkey voterPubkey)`

Returns all locked governance FTs to voter after `unlockTimestamp`.

### `earlyReclaim(sig voterSig, pubkey voterPubkey, int proposalFinalStatus)`

Returns tokens before `unlockTimestamp` if the proposal is done. Caller must pass a valid terminal status: `2` (EXECUTED), `3` (CANCELLED), or `4` (EXPIRED).

<Note>
BCH has no cross-UTXO reads. The voter supplies `proposalFinalStatus` as a parameter — the covenant only validates that the value is one of the valid terminal statuses. Off-chain verification of the proposal status is the caller's responsibility.
