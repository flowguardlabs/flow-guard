FlowGuard is a token backed payment protocol that turns BCH into programmable financial flows. It encodes streaming, vesting, and recurring payment logic directly into covenant enforced UTXOs, enabling programmable treasury systems and token native economic flows without requiring account based smart contracts.

## How It Works

FlowGuard designs economic logic, coordination logic, and incentive mechanics on BCH. Each deployed contract is a covenant UTXO controlled by a CashToken NFT that encodes state, transitioned via defined function calls, and enforced entirely at the consensus level. 

<Note>
FlowGuard is not just a treasury dashboard or a multisig tool. CashTokens act as state commitments, ensuring all transitions are verified onchain without custody risk.
