FlowGuard brings programmable token flows to Bitcoin Cash using CashScript covenants and the CashTokens standard. Every schedule, distribution, and treasury is enforced directly by on-chain covenant bytecode — no backend server holds keys, no admin can rug funds mid-flight.

## How It Works

FlowGuard covenants are CashScript contracts compiled to P2SH32 addresses on BCH. State is stored inside a CashTokens NFT commitment (up to 40 bytes) attached to the covenant UTXO. Each function call consumes the input UTXO and produces a new output UTXO with updated state — making every state transition an auditable on-chain transaction.

<Note>
FlowGuard never custodies your keys or funds. All spending paths are enforced cryptographically by the covenant bytecode itself.
