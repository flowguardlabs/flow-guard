`AirdropCovenant` lets any eligible address claim a fixed `amountPerClaim` from a funded pool. Claims are permissionless — the claimer self-signs. Authority controls campaign-level pause, resume, and cancel.

## Use Cases

- Token launches and community drops
- Protocol incentive distributions
- Retroactive user rewards

## How It Works

```mermaid

    A([Authority deploys\nfunds totalPool]) --> B[ACTIVE\ntotalClaimed = 0]
    B >|claim - anyone| C[Claimer receives\namountPerClaim]
    C >|totalClaimed < totalPool| B
    C >|totalClaimed >= totalPool| D([COMPLETED])
    B >|pause| E[PAUSED]
    E >|resume| B
    B >|cancel| F([Remaining pool\nreturned to authority])
```

## Key Properties

| Property | Detail |
|-|-|
| Claim amount | Fixed. Identical for every claimer. |
| Eligibility | Any address that can sign. No allowlist (on-chain). Off-chain eligibility via backend check. |
| Time window | Optional `startTimestamp` and `endTimestamp` |
| Pool behavior | Auto-completes when `totalClaimed >= totalPool` |
| Authority | Can pause, resume, or cancel. Cancel returns remainder. |
