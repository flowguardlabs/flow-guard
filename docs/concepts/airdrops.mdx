`AirdropCovenant` lets eligible addresses claim a fixed `amountPerClaim` from a funded pool. Claims require two signatures: the claimer and a backend-held claim-authority key. Authority controls campaign-level pause, resume, and cancel.

## Use Cases

- Token launches and community drops
- Protocol incentive distributions
- Retroactive user rewards

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A([Authority deploys\nfunds totalPool]) --> B[ACTIVE\ntotalClaimed = 0]
    B  -->|claim - claimer + claim-authority| C[Claimer receives\namountPerClaim]
    C  -->|totalClaimed < totalPool| B
    C  -->|totalClaimed >= totalPool| D([COMPLETED])
    B  -->|pause| E[PAUSED]
    E  -->|resume| B
    B  -->|cancel| F([Remaining pool\nreturned to authority])
```

## Key Properties

| Property | Detail |
|-|-|
| Claim amount | Fixed. Identical for every claimer. |
| Eligibility | Enforced off-chain by claim-authority co-signing policy (open or merkle/KYC). |
| Time window | Optional `startTimestamp` and `endTimestamp` |
| Pool behavior | Auto-completes when `totalClaimed >= totalPool` |
| Authority | Can pause, resume, or cancel. Cancel returns remainder. |
