`GrantCovenant` releases funding tranche by tranche as milestones are approved by the authority. The total grant is split equally across a defined number of milestones.

## Use Cases

- Developer grants with delivery milestones
- Research funding disbursed in phases
- Contractor payments tied to deliverables

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A([Deploy\nN milestones\nfund totalAmount]) > B[Milestone 0\nActive]
    B >|releaseMilestone - authority| C[amountPerMilestone\nto recipient]
    C >|completed < total| B
    C >|completed = total| D([COMPLETED])
    B >|transfer - recipient| E[New recipient\nassigned]
    E > B
    B >|cancel - authority| F([Remaining returned\nto authority])
```

## Key Properties

| Property | Detail |
|-|-|
| Payout per milestone | Fixed: `totalAmount / milestonesTotal` |
| Release control | Authority only — off-chain milestone verification |
| Recipient | Mutable if `FLAG_TRANSFERABLE`. Current recipient signs to reassign. |
| Cancel | Authority returns `totalAmount - totalReleased` |
