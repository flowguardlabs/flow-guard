## Asset Types

Every FlowGuard covenant supports two asset modes selected by `FLAG_USES_TOKENS` (`0x04` in the flags byte):

| Mode | Flag | What is held | Output enforcement |
|-|-|-|-|
| BCH mode | `FLAG_USES_TOKENS = 0` | Satoshis in the UTXO value | `tx.outputs[0].value == amount` |
| Token mode | `FLAG_USES_TOKENS = 1` | CashToken FT units | `tx.outputs[0].tokenAmount == amount` |

The mode is set at deployment and encoded into the NFT flags byte. It cannot change.

## BCH Streams

In BCH mode, the covenant holds satoshis directly. Amounts are expressed in satoshis (1 BCH = 100,000,000 satoshis). The minimum meaningful amount is limited by the BCH dust limit (~546 satoshis).

## CashToken Streams

In token mode, the covenant holds CashToken fungible token units. The `tokenCategory` of the NFT and the FT escrow are the same, linking them in a single UTXO. The token amount field tracks the escrowed FT units separately from the BCH satoshi value (which only covers the UTXO dust amount).

<Info>
When creating a CashToken stream, the covenant UTXO must hold both:
1. A small BCH dust amount to make the UTXO valid
2. The FT amount to be streamed under the same `tokenCategory` as the state NFT
</Info>

## Supported Token Standards

Any CashToken fungible token with a valid `tokenCategory` is supported. This includes:

- BCMR-registered tokens with published metadata
- Protocol tokens (DeFi, governance, utility)
- Unregistered fungible tokens with any category

FlowGuard does not whitelist or verify token categories at the contract level. Sender and recipient are responsible for verifying the token being streamed.
