`BountyCovenant` funds a competition with a fixed prize per winner, up to `maxWinners`. The authority reviews submissions off-chain and co-signs each `claim()` with a non-zero `proofHash` identifying the work.

## Use Cases

- Code bounties (bug fixes, feature implementations)
- Design or content competitions
- Research prize pools
- Security vulnerability disclosures
