`RewardCovenant` lets an authority issue variable amounts to recipients for arbitrary events — achievements, referrals, loyalty milestones, or custom categories. Unlike airdrops (fixed, self-claim), rewards require the authority to sign each payout and set the exact amount.

## Use Cases

- Achievement rewards (reach milestones in a protocol)
- Referral bonuses (variable by referee activity)
- Loyalty programs (tiered rewards based on usage)
- Custom incentive campaigns

## How It Works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A([Deploy\nfund totalPool]) > B[ACTIVE]
    B >|reward - authority\nvariable amount per event| C[Recipient receives\nrewardAmount]
    C >|totalDistributed < totalPool| B
    C >|totalDistributed >= totalPool| D([COMPLETED])
    B >|cancel - authority| E([Remainder returned])
```

## Reward Categories

The `reward_category` byte in the NFT state records the type for indexing and display:

| Value | Category |
|-|-|
| `1` | ACHIEVEMENT |
| `2` | REFERRAL |
| `3` | LOYALTY |
| `4` | CUSTOM |

## Key Properties

| Property | Detail |
|-|-|
| Amount per event | Variable. Must satisfy `0 < rewardAmount <= maxRewardAmount` |
| Recipients | Different address per reward event |
| Pool | Fixed at deployment — auto-completes when exhausted |
| Authority | Controls all payouts — no self-claim path |

## NFT State

```
[0]:    status

[3-10]: total_distributed (uint64)
[11-18]: rewards_count (uint64)
