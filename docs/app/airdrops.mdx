Airdrops let you distribute BCH or CashTokens to many wallets at once. Two campaign modes are available:

- **Open**: any BCH address can claim up to `maxClaimsPerAddress` times
- **KYC / Whitelisted**: only addresses in the merkle tree can claim, each with a custom amount

## Creating a Campaign

Navigate to **Airdrops → New Campaign** and configure:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Title | Public name for the campaign |
| Token | BCH or a CashToken (requires token category) |
| Total amount | Total pool size |
| Amount per claim | Fixed amount per wallet (open campaigns) |
| Start / End | Optional time window |
| Max claims per address | Defaults to 1 |
| KYC restricted | If on, you must upload a recipient CSV before funding |

After creation, fund the contract. The campaign goes `ACTIVE` once on-chain funding is confirmed.

## Sharing the Claim Link

Every campaign generates a unique claim link like `https://yourapp.com/claim/{token}`. Share it publicly or privately. Recipients click the link and claim with one wallet-signed transaction.

## Managing a Campaign

As the creator you can:

- **Pause**: halt new claims while keeping the contract funded
- **Cancel**: withdraw remaining unclaimed funds

All actions above are on-chain and require a wallet signature.

<Note>
The contract includes a `resume()` function, but the current backend release does not expose a public resume route yet.
