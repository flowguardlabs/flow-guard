Grants (budget plans) release funds to a recipient in structured milestones. Each milestone unlocks after a set duration from the previous release, enforced by the on-chain covenant — no trust required.

## Creating a Grant

Navigate to **Grants → New Grant** and specify:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Recipient | BCH P2PKH address |
| Vault | The vault funding this grant |
| Token | BCH or CashToken |
| Milestones | Array of `{ amount, durationSeconds, description }` |
| Cancelable | Whether unvested funds can be reclaimed |

The entire grant amount is locked upfront in the budget covenant. Milestones unlock sequentially — the recipient cannot claim milestone 2 until milestone 1 has been released and its time period has elapsed.

## Releasing a Milestone

When a milestone period elapses, the recipient navigates to the grant and clicks **Release**. The app builds a release transaction and the wallet signs it. Multiple elapsed milestones can be claimed in a single transaction.

## Cancelling a Grant

The grant controller (vault creator) can cancel at any time. Released milestones are already in the recipient's wallet. Unreleased milestone funds return to the controller address.

See [Create a Grant](/guides/grants/create) for the complete guide.
