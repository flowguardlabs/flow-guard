## Network

FlowGuard currently operates on **Chipnet** (BCH testnet). Mainnet deployment is planned following security audits.

| Component | Status | Network |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Frontend | Live | Chipnet |
| Backend API | Live | Chipnet |
| WalletConnect v2 | Live | Chipnet |
| Indexer | Optional | Chipnet |
| Executor | Optional | Chipnet |

## Checking API Health

```http
GET /health
```

Returns:

```json
{ "status": "ok", "service": "flowguard-backend", "blockchain": "connected" }
```

## Chipnet Faucet

Get test BCH at [tbch.googol.cash](https://tbch.googol.cash/). Chipnet BCH has no real-world value.

## Known Limitations

- **Mainnet not yet live**: all current deployments are on Chipnet
- **Executor is opt-in**: without the executor service, recipients must manually claim their vested amounts
- **Indexer is opt-in**: advanced analytics require the Postgres indexer running separately
- **3-signer requirement**: vaults require exactly 3 signer addresses and public keys
