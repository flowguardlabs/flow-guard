FlowGuard is a BCH-native treasury and payments protocol. The web app connects to your BCH wallet via WalletConnect v2 and lets you deploy covenants directly from the browser — no backend custody, no seed phrases submitted.

## Supported Wallets

FlowGuard works with any WalletConnect v2 compatible BCH wallet:

- **Paytaca**: iOS and Android, full CashTokens support
- **Selene**: mobile and browser extension, full CashTokens support
