Rewards are immediate or scheduled lump-sum distributions to specific addresses. They use a single-claim airdrop or single-milestone budget plan, depending on whether the payout is immediate or deferred.

## Issuing a One-time Reward

Navigate to **Rewards → Issue Reward**:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Recipient | BCH address |
| Amount | BCH or token amount |
| Asset | BCH or CashToken category |
| Release after | 0 for immediate, or a future Unix timestamp |

If **Release after** is 0 or in the past, the recipient can claim immediately after funding is confirmed.

## Recurring Rewards

For ongoing rewards (e.g. monthly contributor stipends), use the **Recurring Payments** product instead and set a `MONTHLY` interval.

## Claiming a Reward

Recipients see outstanding rewards in their **Receiving** tab. A single tap (mobile) or click (desktop) signs and broadcasts the claim. No manual merkle proof required — open rewards need only the claimer's wallet signature.
