Vesting streams release BCH or CashTokens to a recipient over time. Choose linear (continuous) or step (discrete chunks) vesting. See [Create a Vesting Stream](/guides/vesting/create) for the full step-by-step guide.

## Stream Types

| Type | How it works |
|------|-------------|
| **LINEAR** | Tokens vest continuously per second from `startTime` to `endTime` |
| **STEP** | Tokens release in equal chunks at fixed intervals |
| **RECURRING** | Equal payments at calendar intervals (handled via the Payments product) |

## Viewing Your Streams

From **Streams** in the sidebar, you see two tabs:

- **Sending**: streams where your address is the sender
- **Receiving**: streams where your address is the recipient

Each card shows the progress bar (vested %), total amount, asset type, and status.

## Claiming Vested Funds

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the stream">
    Click any stream card in your **Receiving** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check claimable amount">
    The stream detail page shows the current claimable amount based on elapsed time and the on-chain NFT commitment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim">
    Click **Claim**. Your wallet will prompt you to sign the transaction. No gas — BCH covenant execution is nearly free.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    After the wallet broadcasts, the app calls `confirm-claim` and updates your balance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cancelling a Stream

If the stream was created with `cancelable: true`, the sender can cancel at any time. The vested portion goes to the recipient, and the unvested remainder returns to the sender. Navigate to the stream detail and click **Cancel**.

## Asset Support

- **BCH**: amount in whole BCH (e.g., `10.5`)
- **CashTokens (FT)**: amount in base token units, requires `tokenCategory` (hex32 category ID)
