FlowGuard governance lets vault members vote on proposals using their CashTokens as stake. Tokens are locked in a voting covenant for the duration of the voting period and returned automatically after it ends.

## Creating a Proposal

Navigate to **Governance → New Proposal** inside a vault:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Title | What is being decided |
| Description | Full rationale and details |
| Quorum | Minimum total vote weight to pass |
| Voting duration | How many days the vote is open (default 7) |

## Voting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the proposal">
    Navigate to the active proposal and click **Vote**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose your vote">
    Select **For**, **Against**, or **Abstain**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lock tokens">
    Enter the token amount to stake. The app deploys a VoteLockCovenant and returns a `wcTransaction` to fund it with your CashTokens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign">
    Sign the funding transaction in your wallet. Your vote is recorded on-chain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Unlocking After Voting

When the voting period ends, return to the proposal and click **Unlock Tokens**. The covenant releases your staked tokens back to your wallet. Tokens cannot be unlocked before the voting period closes.

## Off-chain Voting

For lightweight internal decisions, proposals also support off-chain voting (no token lock). Call `POST /api/governance/:proposalId/vote` directly or use the simple vote button in the proposal UI. Off-chain votes count toward tallies but do not require token locking.

## Proposal Outcome

FlowGuard does not automatically execute on-chain actions based on governance votes. The proposal outcome informs vault signers who then manually create treasury proposals or modify products accordingly.
