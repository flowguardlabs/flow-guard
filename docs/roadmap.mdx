The FlowGuard roadmap merges protocol upgrades with firm go to market strategies. The goal is to enforce policy onchain while building the dashboards, roles, and analytics that organizations need to operate at scale.

## Phase 1 Revenue Wedge: Proposal Modules and Audit Tooling

Focus: Clear pain points, defensible value, execution trace.

### Proposal Modules
* Enforce proposal schemas natively.
* Templates for grants, budgets, and contract upgrades.
* Milestone gating and strict payout automation.
* Stop vague proposals by making governance repeatable.

### Audit Tooling
* Track proposal intent directly to onchain execution trace.
* Verify contract upgrade risks including bytecode and admin changes.
* Continuous monitoring for suspicious transfers and new privileged roles.
* Audit readiness exports for compliance.

### Technical Upgrades
* **Executor Incentive Layer**: Carve execution fees from recurring payments to incentivize permissionless execution.
* **Deployment Registry Anchor**: Merkle anchored onchain registry UTXO to store a hash of the canonical deployment list.
* **MerkleTreeService**: Allowlist based airdrops where only whitelisted addresses can claim via Merkle proofs.

## Phase 2 Stickiness: Permissioned Roles and Alerts

Focus: Operational control and workflow enforcement.

### Permissioned Roles
* Policy based access control for governance and treasury ops.
* Assign roles (Treasury operations, Risk officer) tied to onchain identity or Treasury NFTs.
* Complete audit trail for permission changes and emergency break glass flows.

### Advanced Treasury UX
* **Single Transaction Deposits**: Lock assets, route payments, and retain liquid balances in one step.
* **Multi Recipient Vesting**: Create multiple vesting covenants from a single vault spend.

### Technical Upgrades
* **Batch Operations**: Contracts and frontend flow to deploy multiple covenant UTXOs in one transaction.
* **Large Allowlists**: Pending Loops CHIP activation to support large arrays.

## Phase 3 Scale: Analytics, Benchmarking, and API

Focus: Decision metrics, risk analysis, and developer tooling.

### High Value Analytics
* Voter concentration and capture risk metrics.
* Delegate performance tracking and proposal ROI.
* Treasury risk analytics covering stablecoin exposure and volatility.
* Operational KPIs including time to execution and dispute rates.

### Infrastructure and Automation
* **Developer SDK**: Installable package with contract factory, reusable covenant templates, and example integrations.
* **GraphQL API Layer**: Eliminate over fetching and co locate data requirements.
* **Railway Multi Service**: Split API, indexer, and executor into independently scaling services.

### Technical Upgrades
* **Arbitrary Signers**: Pending Loops CHIP to support dynamic M of N configurations.
* **Governance Tally Contract**: Accumulate and finalize vote UTXOs into a canonical tally.

## Phase 4 Premium Expansion: Privacy and Selective Disclosure

Focus: Protecting contributors without losing accountability.

### Privacy Layers
* **Selective Disclosure Proofs**: Prove payments are within budget without revealing full payroll details.
* **Private Deployments**: Opt in disclosure for auditors and signers.
* **Future Expansions**: Private voting to reduce bribery, and private treasury movements.

### Ecosystem Integrations
* **Stablecoin Vaults**: Native support for stable CashTokens with UI level accounting.
* **USD Denominated Streams**: Oracle priced payments recalculated dynamically at execution time.
* **AI Agent Economy**: API hooks for automated disbursement approvals and proposal execution.
